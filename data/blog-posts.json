Targeting the Wrong Keywords</h2><p>Focusing on high-volume, low-intent keywords wastes budget. Target keywords that indicate purchase intent.</p><h2>6. Neglecting Email Marketing</h2><p>Email marketing has the highest ROI of any digital marketing channel. Don't ignore this powerful tool.</p><h2>7. Inconsistent Branding</h2><p>Inconsistent branding confuses customers and dilutes your marketing efforts.</p><h2>8. Not Testing and Optimizing</h2><p>Digital marketing requires continuous testing and optimization to improve performance.</p><h2>9. Ignoring Customer Feedback</h2><p>Customer feedback is valuable for improving your marketing strategy and customer experience.</p><h2>10.
